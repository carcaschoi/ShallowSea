# Wiki
[The wiki is here!](https://github.com/yanisdreemurr/ShallowSea-Fork/wiki)

# To do list
- Remove potentially dangerous applications for the user (to avoid being banned)
- Remove remaining files from sxos 
- Remove all .nsp files and other applications .... 

# Liability:
Nobody is responsible if you lose your data, brick your Switch, get banned, drop your Switch into the toilet, have your Switch stolen by ninjas, [etc 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwvYiMK3ik) [etc 2](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLK6G4JP74vhF7UQwzdcXfG2eLclu-GcEc), except yourself. By using ShallowSea or any form of homebrew in any capacity you understand the risks involved with running unsigned code on your Switch.

(On this fork, Me [yanisdreemurr](https://github.com/yanisdreemurr) and [carcaschoi](https://github.com/carcaschoi) will not be responsible for anything if your switch is banned from online mode.)
