# What is the Different between [ShallowSea-ams+reinxspoof.rar] & [ShallowSea-neutos]
[I recomended to use [ShallowSea-neutos] if you are a rookie]()

### ShallowSea-ams+reinxspoof

**pros**
* can get support from atmosphere-nx if they are not about piracy
* can get update as soon as possible

**cons (mainly about ReiNX-spoofer)**
* Since some homebrew app detect ReiNX because of ReiNX-spoofer, they may have error. Solution: Disable the plugin & reboot the console before using these app.

### ShallowSea-neutos

**pros**
* Do not have problem when using the homebrew app that force atmosphere to run

**cons**
* cannot get support from official [Atmosphere-NX](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere) because NeutOS is a modded version of atmosphere
* If the owner of neutos does not update neutos, then you cannot use the latest version of atmosphere


* **For [ShallowSea-ams+reinxspoof.rar]** If there is an error when running some homebrew app that force atmosphere to run, you may disable **ReiNX-Spoofer** by using tesla menu or deepsea toolbox before running these homebrew app
