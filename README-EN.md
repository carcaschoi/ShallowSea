# To do list:
* Create wiki to tidy up readme file
* Choose a license

# Liability:
Nobody is responsible if you lose your data, brick your Switch, get banned(although ShallowSea has ban protection), drop your Switch into the toilet, have your Switch stolen by ninjas, [etc 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnwvYiMK3ik) [etc 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X5kP6NjDTw), except yourself. By using ShallowSea or any form of homebrew in any capacity you understand the risks involved with running unsigned code on your Switch.
